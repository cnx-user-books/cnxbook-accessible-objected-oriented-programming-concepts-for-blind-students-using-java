	<h1><a name="Preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>This module is part of a collection titled <strong>Accessible 
Objected-Oriented Programming Concepts for Blind Students using Java</strong>. 
It explains some of the physical aspects of sound in 
	a format that is accessible to blind students. It also explains a little 
	about the trigonometric sine and cosine functions and suggests that they can 
	be used to create sound with a computer. An audio file is provided where 
	audio pulses of different frequencies are used to represent points on a 
	graph of a sinusoid.</p>

<p id="p1016">By this point in the course, you should have learned enough that 
you can put Java OOP to work in a substantive way. Normally at this point, my 
sighted students would begin using OOP to manipulate the pixels and colors in 
digital images. That is not well suited to teaching OOP to blind students. 
In this course, which is designed specifically for blind students, you will 
begin writing substantive programs that deal with something that you are 
probably very good at -- sound.</p>
<p id="p1017">For example, you will soon learn how to write a Java OOP program to 
produce simple sounds such as
<a href="TonesStereo.au">TonesStereo</a> . </p>
<p><em>(Note that if you are viewing the HTML version of this module on the Legacy 
site, you should be able to download this file and the other audio files in this 
module and play them using any standard 
media player that supports audio files of type AU. However, if you are on the OpenStax site, or if 
you are viewing the PDF version of this module on either site, you may not be 
able to download the file.) </em></p>
<p id="p1018">As you study future modules in this collection, you will learn to write OOP 
programs to produce more complex sounds such as
<a id="a1137" href="StereoPingpong.au">
StereoPingpong </a>. </p>
<p id="p1019">Ultimately you will learn to write OOP programs that can be used 
to compose and play various melodies such as the following: </p>

	<h2><a name="What_is_sound">What is sound</a>?</h2>
<p>An old physics question goes something like this. If the earth were populated 
solely by humans and a tree fell in the forest with no humans present, would it 
make a sound?</p>
<p>The answer is "No, it would not make a sound." The explanation  
follows.</p>
<h3><a name="Vibration">Vibration</a></h3>
<p>Assume that someone strikes the top of a car with their hand. This would 
cause the metal roof of the car to start 
vibrating. That vibration would cause the adjacent air molecules to also vibrate 
causing them to collide with their neighbors. Those molecules would collide with 
their neighbors, and on and on. We can think of this as a wave of vibrating molecules 
propagating outward from the car.</p>
<p>This wave of vibrating molecules propagates outward at a speed of 
approximately one mile every five seconds and decreases in intensity as it 
propagates out from the source. At some distance from the source, the intensity 
of the vibrations has decreased to an insignificant level.</p>
<h3><a name="Sensing_the_vibrations">Sensing vibration</a></h3>
<p>If you are standing somewhere between the car and the point at which the 
vibrations are no longer significant, the air molecules in your ear canals will 
begin to vibrate. This will stimulate nerves that lead from your ear to your 
brain. Your brain will interpret the stimulation as something that we refer to
<em>sound</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the tree falls, it causes the air molecules to vibrate. However, if 
there are no ear canals around, no nerves to be stimulated, and no brain to interpret 
that stimulation, there is no sound.</p>
<h2><a name="Creating_sound_with_a_hammer">Creating sound with a hammer</a></h2>
<p>All we need to do to cause a person to experience <em>sound</em> 
is to cause the air molecules in that person's ear canals to vibrate at a 
frequency somewhere between 20 Hz <em>(cycles per second)</em> and 20,000 Hz, 
depending on the person's age. Usually as a person ages, the range defined by 
those upper and lower limits decreases. Thus, a young person may "hear" the 
high-pitched whine of a power saw while an older person may not experience sound 
in that situation.</p>
<p>There are many ways that we can cause most humans to experience sound. One 
way for example, is to strike a bell with a hammer. Another way is to write a 
program to cause the diaphragm of a computer <em>speaker</em> to vibrate. That will be the topic of 
the next few modules in this course.</p>
<h2><a name="Creating_sound_with_a_computer">Creating sound with a 
computer</a></h2>
<p>One way to create sound with a computer would be to hold it out and drop it 
on the floor. However, that is not what we intend to do. Instead, we intend to 
write computer program that will cause the computer to create sound.</p>
<h3><a name="An_object_of_a_class">An object of a class</a></h3>
<p>As you will learn in a future module, we can define a class and instantiate 
an object of that class for use in producing sound with a computer. When used 
properly in a program, that object will cause signed numeric values stored in an array to 
be converted to electrical current in the speakers attached to the computer. 
Positive values will cause the current to flow in one direction and negative 
values will cause the current to flow in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3><a name="Alternating_positive_and_negative_values">Alternating positive and 
negative values</a></h3>
<p>If we populate that array with alternating groups of positive and negative 
values, that will cause the current being delivered to the speakers to 
alternate, switching from one direction to the other. The level of the 
alternating currents will be roughly proportional to the magnitudes of the 
alternating positive and negative values. Given sufficient magnitude within a 
frequency range supported by the speakers, the alternating currents will cause 
the diaphragms of the speakers to vibrate or move back and forth. This, in turn, 
will cause the adjacent air molecules to vibrate, which may be sensed as sound 
by a person within hearing distance of the speakers.</p>
<h2><a name="Sine_and_cosine_functions">Sine and cosine functions</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Populating_the_array">Populating the array</a></h3>
<p>There are many ways that we can write a program to populate the array with 
alternating groups of positive and negative numbers. One of the simplest ways is to 
populate the array with scaled versions of the values produced by the static
<strong>sin</strong> function or the static <strong>cos</strong> function of the <strong>Math</strong> 
class. The <strong>Math</strong> class is contained in the Java Standard Edition class library. A common 
name for a series of such values is <em>sinusoid</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to being one of the easiest ways to populate the array, this is also a 
way to produce a sound that is very close to being a<em> pure tone</em>. By pure 
tone, I mean a sound that results from something vibrating at a single frequency 
such as Middle-C <em>((261.63 Hz)</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="The_shape_of_a_sinusoid">The shape of a sinusoid</a></h3>
<p>If you have taken a math course in trigonometry, you probably know the shape 
produced by graphing the output from either the <strong>sin</strong> function or 
the <strong>cos</strong> function. If not, it would be good if you can ask a 
sighted friend to Google for "sinusoidal function image", download and print one 
or more of the images and emboss them for you using whatever embossing method 
you prefer. This will provide you with a tactile representation of a sinusoid.</p>
<h3><a name="An_audio_graph_of_a_sinusoid">An audio graph of a sinusoid</a></h3>
<p>In any event, I am going to provide you with a sound file named
<a href="SinusoidalAudioGraph.au">SinusoidalAudioGraph</a> that provides an 
audio representation of the graph of a sinusoid.</p>
<p>This audio file contains an 8-second melody consisting of 32 uniformly spaced pulses at 
different frequencies. The frequencies <em>(pitches)</em> of the pulses are centered on middle-C
<em>(261.63 Hz)</em>. The frequency deviation from middle-C versus time 
is based on a sinusoidal function with a frequency of 0.5 Hz. </p>
<h3><a name="Points_on__graph">Points on graph</a></h3>
<p>Each pulse 
represents one point on a graph of the sinusoid. Pulses with frequencies at or 
above middle-C are delivered to the left speaker. Pulses with frequencies below 
middle-C are delivered to the right speaker. </p>
<p>The audio output can be thought of as an 
audio representation of a graph of a sinusoid. Pulses with frequencies above 
middle-C represent points on the positive lobe of the sinusoid. Increasing pitch 
represents increasing amplitude on the graph of the sinusoid. </p>
<p>Pulses with 
frequencies below middle-C can be thought of as representing points on the 
negative lobe of the sinusoid. In this case, decreasing pitch represents points 
on the sinusoid that are further from the horizontal axis in the negative 
direction. </p>
<p>Pulses with a frequency of middle-C can be thought of as representing 
points on the horizontal axis with a value of zero. </p>
<p>Four complete cycles 
of the 0.5 Hz sinusoid are represented by the 32 pulses in the 8-second melody.</p>
<p>Hopefully, by listening to this audio file, you can get an idea of the shape 
of a sinusoid.</p>
<h3><a name="A_dual_purpose">A dual purpose</a></h3>
<p>In addition to providing the audio file to help you discern the shape of a 
sinusoid, I am also providing it as an example of the type of audio files that 
you will be able to create once you understand the programs in upcoming modules.</p>
