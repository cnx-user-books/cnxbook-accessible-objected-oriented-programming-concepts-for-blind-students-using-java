<p>This module is part of a collection of modules designed to make 
object-oriented programming 
concepts accessible to blind students.</p>
<p>Blind students should not be excluded from computer programming courses 
because of inaccessible textbooks. Because of its text-based nature, computer 
programming is fundamentally an accessible technology. However, many textbooks 
adopt and use high-level integrated development environments with graphical user 
interfaces that greatly reduce that accessibility.</p>
<p>The modules in this collection present object-oriented programming concepts in a 
format that blind students can read using tools such as an audio screen reader 
and an electronic line-by-line Braille display.</p>
<p>In an effort to get and keep the student's interest, the more advanced 
modules in this collection also make heavy 
use of programming projects that provide sensory feedback through the use of sound.</p>
<p>The collection is intended to supplement but not to 
replace the textbook in an introductory course in high school or college 
object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>This module explains how to get started programming in Java in a format that is 
designed to be accessible to blind students.</p>
<h2><a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>In addition to an Internet connection and a browser, you will need the 
following tools <em>(as a minimum) </em>to work through the exercises in these modules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An audio screen reader that is compatible with your operating system, 
	such as the NonVisual Desktop Access program (NVDA), which is freely 
	available at <a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">
	http://www.nvda-project.org/</a>.</li>
	<li>A refreshable Braille display capable of providing line by line tactile output of information displayed on the computer monitor 
	is recommended. Such a display is described at
	<a href="http://www.userite.com/ecampus/lesson1/tools.php">http://www.userite.com/ecampus/lesson1/tools.php</a>, is 
	recommended.</li>
	<li>The Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) <em>(See
	<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>)</em></li>
	<li>Documentation for the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) <em>(See
	<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">
	http://download.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/</a>)</em></li>
	<li>A simple IDE or text editor for use in writing Java code.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The minimum prerequisites for understanding the material in these modules 
	include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A cursory understanding of algebra.</li>
	<li>An understanding of the material covered in the <em>Programming 
	Fundamentals</em> modules that you will find in two formats at the following URLs. These 
	modules provide fundamental programming concepts using the Java programming 
	language in a format that should be accessible. <ul>

<h1> <a name="Discussion">Discussion</a></h1>
<p>Considering that during the past fifteen years, I have published 
several hundred online programming tutorials <em>(see
<a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/toc.htm">http://www.dickbaldwin.com/toc.htm</a>
), </em>one might wonder why I am taking the time and expending the effort to 
publish still another online programming tutorial.</p>
<h2><a name="Accessibility_is_the_keyword">Accessibility is the keyword</a></h2>
<p> When writing and publishing the earlier tutorials, I made no attempt to make 
them accessible to blind students. Some of them are probably accessible, simply 
because I used a relatively simple HTML format and didn&#39;t include any 
inaccessible content such as images. However, many of the earlier tutorials make 
heavy use of images and will therefore be inaccessible to blind students.</p>
<p> In writing this collection of modules <em>(tutorials)</em>, I will make a 
concentrated effort to make them accessible to blind students.</p>
<p> Some of the 
earlier tutorials that include images do so because the purpose of the tutorial 
was to teach students how to manipulate graphic images.</p>
<p> Other tutorials, however, 
included images in sample programs simply as a way to provide sensory feedback 
to the students and give them a feeling of accomplishment. I believe that 
providing sensory feedback in sample programs makes the process of 
learning how to program more interesting for the students.</p>
<h2> <a name="Sound_and_music">Sound and music</a></h2>
<p> In this collection of modules, I will use sound instead of images to provide 
sensory feedback. The sound will be of a form that is often referred to as <em>
sampled sound</em>. In sampled sound, the actual waveform of the sound is 
sampled as a series of numeric values. At playback time, those numeric values 
are applied in sequence to a device that reproduces the original waveform and 
feeds that waveform to amplifiers, speakers, etc. This is the type of sound that 
is commonly found on a music CD.</p>
<p> While I am not a musician, I will also show you how to write a Java program 
that you can use to compose and play melodies based on the nomenclature used in 
sheet music (A, A#, B, C, C#, etc.). In fact, if you have a cursory knowledge of how to read 
sheet music <em>(or the accessible equivalent of sheet music)</em>, you will be able to copy the information from a piece of sheet 
music into a text file and play it on your computer using the program that you 
will write.</p>
<p> Here is a link to a file named <a href="MaryLamb.au">MaryLamb.au</a> containing a simple melody produced 
using that program. <em>(If 
you have musical talent, you can produce much more complex music than this 
simple melody.)</em> You should be able to download and play this melody using 
any standard media player that supports sound files of type AU. However, you may 
need to revert to the <em>
<a href="http://legacy.cnx.org/content/m40794/1.4/Jbs1000.htm">legacy</a></em> format of this module to 
download the file.</p>

Writing, compiling, and running Java programs</a></h1>
<h2><a name="Writing_the_code">Writing Java code</a></h2>
<p>Fortunately, writing Java code is straightforward. You can write Java code 
using any plain text editor. You simply need to cause the output file to have 
an extension of .java.</p>
<p>There are a number of high-level <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em> 
available, such as Eclipse and NetBeans, but they tend to be overkill for the relatively simple Java programs 
described in these modules.</p>
<p>There are also some low-level IDEs available, such as JCreator and DrJava, 
which are very useful for sighted students. However, I don&#39;t know anything about 
their level of accessibility. I normally use a free version of JCreator, mainly 
because it contains a color-coded editor, but that feature wouldn&#39;t be useful 
for a blind student.</p>
<p>So, just find an editor that you are happy with and use it to write your Java 
code.</p>
<h2><a name="Preparing_to_compile_and_run_Java_code">Preparing to compile and 
run Java code</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most complicated thing is to get your computer set up for 
compiling and running Java code in the first place.</p>
<h3><a name="The_java_development_kit">Downloading the java development kit <em>(JDK)</em></a></h3>
<p>You will need to download and install the free Java JDK from
the Oracle website. As of August 2014, you will find that website at
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a></p>
<h3><a name="Installation_of_the_JDK">Installing the JDK</a></h3>
<p>As of August 2014, you will find installation instructions for JDK 8 at
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A word of caution</strong></p>
<p>If you happen to be running Windows Vista, you may need to use something like 
the following when updating the PATH Environment Variable</p>
<pre>;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin</pre>
<p>in place of</p>
<pre>;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin</pre>
<p>as shown in the installation instructions.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have any experience with any Linux version. 
Therefore, I don&#39;t have any hints to offer there.</p>
<h3><a name="The_JDK_documentation">The JDK documentation</a></h3>
<p>It is very difficult to program in Java without access to the documentation 
for the JDK.</p>
<p>Several different types of Java documentation are available online at 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/">
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/</a>.</p>
<p>Specific documentation for classes, methods, etc., for JDK 8 is available online at
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/</a>. </p>
<p>It is also possible to download the documentation and install it locally if 
you have room on your disk. As of August 2014, you can download the 
documentation for JDK 8 from
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Compiling_and_running_Java_code">Compiling and running Java code</a></h2>
<p>There are a variety of ways to compile and run Java code. The way that I will 
describe here is the most basic and, in my opinion, the most reliable. These instructions 
apply to a Windows operating system. If you are using a different operating 
system, you will need to translate the instructions to your operating system.</p>
<h3><a name="Write_your_Java_program">Write your Java program</a></h3>
<p>Begin by using your text editor to write your Java program <em>(see
<a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> for example)</em> into one or more 
text files, each with an extension of 
.java. <em>(Files of this type are often referred to as source code files.)</em> Save the 
source code files in an empty folder somewhere on your disk. Make sure that the 
name of the <strong>class</strong> containing the <strong>main</strong> 
method <em>(which you will learn about in a future module)</em> matches the name of the 
file in which that class is contained <em>(except for the extension of .java on the file name, 
which does not appear in the class name)</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="Create_a_batch_file">Create a batch file</a></h3>
<p class="style2">Use your text editor to create a batch file <em>(or whatever the equivalent is for your operating system)</em> 
containing the text shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> <em>(with the 
modifications discussed below)</em> and store it 
in the same folder as your Java source code files..</p>
<p>Then execute the batch file, which in turn will execute the program if there 
are no compilation errors.</p>

<table border="10" width="677">
<thead><tr><th>
<a name="Listing_1">Listing 1</a>. Windows batch file.
</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>
<pre>
echo off
cls

del *.class

javac -cp .; hello.java
java -cp .; hello

pause</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>Comments regarding the batch file</strong></p>

<p>The commands in the batch file of <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> will </p>
<ul>
	<li>Open a command-line screen for the folder containing the batch 
	file.</li>
	<li>Delete all of the compiled class files from the folder. <em>(If the folder 
	doesn&#39;t contain any class files, this will be indicated on the command-line 
	screen.)</em></li>
	<li>Attempt to compile the program in the file named <strong>hello.java.</strong></li>
	<li>Attempt to run the compiled program using a compiled Java file named
	<strong>hello.class</strong>.</li>
	<li>Pause and wait for you to dismiss the command-line screen by pressing a 
	key on the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>If errors occur, they will be reported on the command-line screen and the 
program won&#39;t be executed.</p>
<p>If your program is named something other than <strong>hello</strong>, 
<em>(which it typically would be)</em> substitute the new name for the word <strong>hello</strong> 
where it appears twice in the batch 
file.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t delete the pause command</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>pause</strong> command causes the command-line window to stay on the 
screen until you dismiss it by pressing a key on the keyboard. You will need to examine the contents of the window if there are errors 
when you attempt to compile and run your program, so don&#39;t delete the pause 
command.</p>
<p><strong>Translate to other operating systems</strong></p>
<p>The format of the batch file in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> is a Windows format. If 
you are using a different operating system, you will need to translate the 
information in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> into the correct format for your operating system.</p>
<h3><a name="A_test_program">A test program</a></h3>
<p>The test program in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> can be used to confirm that Java is properly 
installed on your computer and that you can successfully compile and execute 
Java programs.</p>
<table border="10" width="677">
<thead><tr><th>
<a name="Listing_2">Listing 2</a>. A test program.
</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>
<pre>class hello {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>Copy the code shown in <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a> into a text file 
named <strong>hello.java</strong> and store in an empty folder somewhere on your disk.</p>
<p>Create a batch file named <strong>hello.bat</strong> containing the text 
shown in <a href="#Listing_1">Listing 1</a> and store that file in the same folder as the file named
<strong>hello.java</strong>.</p>
<p>Execute the batch file.</p>
<p>If everything is working, a command-line screen 
should open and display the following text:</p>
<pre>Hello World
Press any key to continue . . .</pre>
<p><strong>Congratulations</strong></p>
<p>If that happens, you have just written, compiled and 
executed your first Java program.</p>
<p><strong>Oops</strong></p>
<p>If that doesn&#39;t happen, you need to go back to the installation instructions 
and see if you can determine why the JDK isn&#39;t properly installed.</p>
<p>If you get an error message similar to the following, that probably means 
that you didn&#39;t set the <strong>path</strong> environment variable correctly. </p>
<pre>&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.</pre>
<p>Beyond that, I can&#39;t provide much advice in the way of troubleshooting hints. </p>
